# Cognition Lattice Documentation

The documentation set captures architecture, operational guides, and decision history.

- `adr/` contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) describing significant choices.
- `vision.md` articulates the long-term intent of the system.

When contributing new subsystems or modifying architecture, add or update ADRs and keep diagrams in Markdown using Mermaid for portability.
